_Click_ or _Right-click_ and choose "*Open Link in New Tab*" (FF) "*Open Link in New Window*" (IE) on one or both of the Donate icon above to be transferred to the Paypal site. There you start by entering your donation amount and _Click_ "*Update Total*" on the top of the page.  After that you either _log in_ to your existing Paypal account or _create a new_ one.  Once you have done this you have the option to "*Add special instructions to seller*", for instance that you want to remain anonymous, before you _Click_ the yellow "*Donate €*(your amount) *Now*"-button down to the right and you are done and we are very grateful.
