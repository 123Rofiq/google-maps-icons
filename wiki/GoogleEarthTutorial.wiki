The goal of this tutorial is to help you use the content of this Google Map Icons project to make your own custom made Google Earth maps easier to understand, to navigate and in the process also make them more consistent and professional looking.

Note: although this tutorial was written for the Windows version of Google Earth the same actions also apply for the Mac version of Google Earth and the Mac OS X versions of Firefox, Safari and Chrome browsers.

=Create a new "placemark"=

[http://google-maps-icons.googlecode.com/files/googlearthtutorial01.png]

   1. After starting Google Earth _locate_ the area where you wish to place a placemark. Go to the upper toolbar and _click_ on the *Add Placemark button*

[http://google-maps-icons.googlecode.com/files/googlearthtutorial02.png]

A New Placemark dialog box appears and a New Placemark icon is centered in the viewer inside a flashing yellow square.

 # Give the placemark a *name*
 # Enter information in the *description* field if you like
 # Drag the New Placemark icon to the *desired location*. You don't have to be exact since you can move it later again
 # Click the *icon for the placemark* to choose an alternate icon, this is covered in the next section of this tutorial
 # Click *OK* when finished. Your placemark appears in the 3D viewer and as an entry in the selected folder:

You can *edit, move or delete* any placemark that appears in the *My Places* or *Temporary Places folder*. To edit and move a placemark *right-click a “placemark”* in the 3D viewer or in the Places panel and choose *Properties*.

=Change the placemark icon=

Select the placemark which icon has to be changed and:

 # Right-click the placemark in the Places panel and select *properties*
 # OR right-click the placemark in the 3D viewer and select properties
 # Click the icon for the placemark, the icon palette dialog box appears. Here you can choose another icon from the default Google Earth icon palette and change properties like color, scale and opacity:

To change the icon to a custom icon from this project site:

 # Click Add Custom Icon... from the icon palette. The Icon Location dialog box opens:

[http://google-maps-icons.googlecode.com/files/googlearthtutorial06.png]

 # Put a valid path or Web URL in the field next to Icon location label or click Browse to specify the file on your computer or network. If you refer to an image on the web, be sure you have entered the path to the image itself, not the web page containing the image.

==Copy the URL to the new icon in Firefox==

Now you need to go back to the page on this project site where you found the icon that you want to use. This because you need to copy its URL (the address to the location where it is on the project server) so that your Google Map can find it. 

 # Right Click on the icon you want
 # Click on *Copy Image Location*

==Copy the URL to the new icon in Safari==

[http://google-maps-icons.googlecode.com/files/googlearthtutorial10.png]

Now you need to go back to the page on this project site where you found the icon that you want to use. This because you need to copy its URL (the address to the location where it is on the project server) so that your Google Map can find it. 

 # Right Click on the icon you want
 # Click on *Copy Image Address*

==Copy the URL to the new icon in Google Chrome==

[http://google-maps-icons.googlecode.com/files/googlearthtutorial11.png]

Now you need to go back to the page on this project site where you found the icon that you want to use. This because you need to copy its URL (the address to the location where it is on the project server) so that your Google Map can find it. 

 # Right Click on the icon you want
 # Click on *Copy Image URL*


==Copy the URL to the new icon in Internet Explorer==

[http://google-maps-icons.googlecode.com/files/GMI-HowToCreate-06.png]

Now you need to go to the page on this project site where you found the icon that you want to use. This because you need to copy its URL (the address to where it is on the project server) so that your Google Map can find it. 

 # Right Click on the icon you want
 # Click on Properties
 # Mark the Address: (URL) by triple-clicking on the URL
 # Right Click on the now *highlighted URL*
 # Click on *Copy*

=Add the selected custom icon to the placemark=

Now switch back to Google Earth where the Icon Location dialog box is still open:

[http://google-maps-icons.googlecode.com/files/googlearthtutorial07.png]

 # *Right Click* in the Icon Location field
 # Click on *Paste* (or type CTRL-C in the Icon Location Field)
 # Edit size, color and opacity if needed
 # Click *OK* to close the Icon palette dialog box
 # Click *OK* again to close the Edit Placemark dialog box

The placemark now has a custom icon in both the Places panel and 3D viewer:
