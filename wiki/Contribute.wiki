==Suggesting new icons==
Suggestions are always very welcome.  Before suggesting a new icon you should first look through the list of icon we already have in the Project Home tab.  We have many, many icons so maybe we already have one that fits.  Secondly you should look at the Requests part of all categories:

[http://code.google.com/p/google-maps-icons/wiki/OfficesIcons#Requests Administration, Office & Industry],
[http://code.google.com/p/google-maps-icons/wiki/CultureIcons#Requests Culture & Entertainment],
[http://code.google.com/p/google-maps-icons/wiki/EducationIcons#Requests Education & Kids],
[http://code.google.com/p/google-maps-icons/wiki/EventsIcons#Requests Events & Weather],
[http://code.google.com/p/google-maps-icons/wiki/FriendsIcons#Requests Friends, Family & Real Estate],
[http://code.google.com/p/google-maps-icons/wiki/MediaIcons#Requests Media],
[http://code.google.com/p/google-maps-icons/wiki/MiscellaneousIcons#Requests Miscellaneous],
[http://code.google.com/p/google-maps-icons/wiki/RestaurantsIcons#Requests Restaurants & Hotels],
[http://code.google.com/p/google-maps-icons/wiki/SportsIcons#Requests Sports, Health & Beauty],
[http://code.google.com/p/google-maps-icons/wiki/StoresIcons#Requests Stores],
[http://code.google.com/p/google-maps-icons/wiki/TourismIcons#Requests Tourism & Nature] and
[http://code.google.com/p/google-maps-icons/wiki/TransportationIcons#Requests Transportation].

This is where our own and others requests are listed. 
Lastly you should look at the 
[http://code.google.com/p/google-maps-icons/issues/list Issues] list to see if someone else already has suggested the icon and that we are already working on it. If you have done all this and still cannot find what you are looking for you are very welcome to make a new suggestion in the 
[http://code.google.com/p/google-maps-icons/issues/entry Issues] tab.

==Designing new icons==
If you are thinking about designing some icons of your own there are a couple of things to consider. We use Photoshop and the free alternative Paint.NET to create out own icons and we follow the simple design rules listed below.

===The Templates===
To make it easier to follow our design rules we provide you with the templates we are using with the official Collection Set Colors, the icon frame and the transparent fading background. You can download the template files from here:

 * [http://google-maps-icons.googlecode.com/files/paint-net-template.pdn Paint.net template] (www.getPaint.NET)
 * [http://google-maps-icons.googlecode.com/files/template-empty.psd Photoshop Template (without icons)]
 * [http://google-maps-icons.googlecode.com/files/template.psd Photoshop Template (with layers and icons)]

... to start adding your designs following theses guidelines written by Matthias:


===About Transparency===
You also need to understand how to work with semi-transparent pixels, like in the
pixels surrounding the icon frame. This to be able to create the icons looking a bit
softer and with more detail then if you paint them with 100% color. An example Layer
with lots of semi-transparent pixels is provided with the Canoe icon.

===About Layers===
You need to understand the principles of working with Layers, like the Layers you
find in the templates below. Key to the icons designed by me is the Layer Blending
Mode found under Layer Properties in Paint.NET.  Icon sybols are never drawn on a
background color, always in their own layer as in the attached Templates. This for
many reasons but most importantly to be able to easily be able change the background
color.

===Some Basic Rules===
The size of the inner icon symbol should never be bigger then 20x20 pixels. Use
common sense with size, a midget needs to be smaller than a gigant even if they look
similar in basic shape. White pixels on the Set standard background is the color for
all symbols (except for the F&F&R Set where it obviously is Black instead). This
means that the Layer with the symbol can only contain White (and Black) pixels, with
0-99% transparency as seen in the example Layer in the attached Templates. Using
Transparency below 25% almost never makes sense.

==Share your icons==
Once you created new icons, you can  [http://code.google.com/p/google-maps-icons/issues/entry propose] and upload it to this project.
If we accept your design, you need to know that we will publish it under the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed Creations Commons Share-Alike 3.0].
