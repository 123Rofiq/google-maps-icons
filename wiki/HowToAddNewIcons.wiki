You can use any image on the web for your placemarks. Just click on the new 'Add an icon' link in the icon menu, type the URL into the dialog box, and you're good to go.

You can host theses files on your own server. Or you can link to theses files directly : you need to "copy the location of the image", then paste into Google Maps.
